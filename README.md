# Hand Tracking Air Gesture Trackpad

I often read or watch content on my laptop while sitting more than an arm's length away. Reaching over everytime I need to scroll or move screens is a hassle and this is my attempt at solving that problem. Coded purely in Python, it uses opencv for camera control, mediapipe for hand tracking, math to create conditions and pyautogui to send keyboard and mouse events.

The current set of gestures imitate the most used gestures on my Macbook's trackpad but new gestures can be added too and I am open to suggestions.
